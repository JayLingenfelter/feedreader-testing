feedreader is a simple application to pull items from an RSS feed and display them in an accessible order.

It is written in JavaScript and accessed with html styled with css.

To use feedreader, just load index.html in a browser. It will automagically make the necessary requests and calls, and produce a list of links for you to peruse.

Happy browsing!
